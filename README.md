Professional portfolio

this project is my first attempt at making my resume into a webpage with working links displays of previous work links to contact me either through email or phone, and a little bit about myself.

this project was done to help showcase what i have learned and the skills i have picked up in the hopes that this will help me land a job in the tech industry.

with this project i found my biggest challenge was my time management, however i also had a few challenges with getting my content to sit in the areas i would prefer them. and after a fair amount of googling and re watching class recordings it started to look like my plan.
